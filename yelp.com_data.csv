Valerie G.,"Miami, FL","Hands down one of the BEST Indian food restaurants I've tried. We went during the Corona Virus Quarantine time and were happy to see they were doing take-out only. They set up their own drive through up front, and delivered your food directly to your car. You can tell they were very cautious in packing the order and used gloves the entire time. They even had to-go wine bottles for $9! It made our quarantine date night-in amazing! I'd give it a 10 star if I could. Support local businesses!"
Penny O.,"Lake Worth, FL","My husband Steve and I decided to get out of the house and take the 25 minute drive to Flames last night. We had called in our order to pick up. Steve did go in to pay and Joe and Subash (owner) made sure our food got to our car. Joe made sure to say hi to me. They were wonderful. When we got home and ate our dinner, it too was fantastic. My mild was not quite as mild as I like, but that was all. We had extra rice, raita and a great night. Flames was the very best part. Looking forward to actually going in and sitting! Thanks to you all. Steve and Penny O'Neill."
Amanda F.,"Tampa, FL","This is our go-to takeout spot for Indian, but we've never gone to the actual restaurant - will do that one day for sure! The food is amazzzzing! So many flavors and a billion options for all the different taste buds. We tend to over order and eat off it for a few days. The best way to close out a long day or week."
Sathi R.,"Bellevue, WA","Owner was very rude. Don't know how to talk  with the customers, About food I don't even want to comment. It was the worst food i ever tried. We tried almost all the items on their menu. Waste of money and time. THINK TWICE BEFORE GOING TO THIS RESTAURANT !!!!  Try at your own risk... Honestly, they don't even deserve one star.."
Huda A.,"Windermere, FL","I was underwhelmed by Flames. I was very excited to try a Halal Indian spot, but the food left me unsatisfied. The chicken tikka masala tasted great, but waaaay too spicy. I couldn't eat more than a few bites without having to give up. I'm not sure if it was just that batch, but it was a struggle. The lamb seekh kababs were a hard pass. They felt frozen and reheated, and had a strong yellow turmeric color that made them look unappetizing. They felt rubbery and didn't taste great either. The malai chicken was just okay - not bad but not great either. But the naan was good. Decent sized portions for everything, but $18 for one serving of chicken tikka masala with white rice is outrageous. 2 orders of seekh kababs, 1 order of malai chicken, 1 chicken tikka masala, and 4 naans totaled $83. Unbelievably expensive."
Tony N.,"Tampa, FL","Pretty good Tandoori Chicken, but I don't recommend the Chicken Biryani. Tandoori Chicken - my favorite Indian dish, I love the exotic red color, the spices, the smoky flavor.  This dish here come with 1 full leg and 1 breast on a bed of veggies and sauce. The price is a bit cheaper than most other places too.  Curious why it's listed under appetizer section, I've always considered this an entree.  You won't be disappointed with the Tandoor Chicken. Chicken Biryani - is average tasting dish.  I would't get it again here because it was a bit too bland. To me good chicken biryani is supposed to hit your taste buds with a flood of quality flavors and spices, which I don't think they used enough spices in this dish.  Also they didn't put in much chicken pieces either.  The chicken chunks are dry and you have to go digging around a bit to find them.  For this $16 dish, what you do get is a large portion size, can serve 2 maybe even 3 people. If you're ordering for pick up, they leave a credit card scanner outside the entrance, which seemed unnecessary since you still have to go inside to tell them why you're there and what you're picking up, then to pay with a CC you go outside, then go back inside to pickup your food."
Sonya G.,"Fairfax, VA","Please please please don't even think of trying out this restaurant. Horrible food!!! Got some food worth 200$ for my my birthday party last night and none of my guests ate anything (it was that tasteless!!!). Can't believe I drove 9 miles for this crappy food.  Called the owner the next day and guess what the owner accuses you of lying instead of understanding the situation. He even laughs at you when you try to explain him what went wrong. During the entire conversation he kept accusing me of not calling him the other night and even suggests you to not WARM up the food telling you it stays warm for 2 hours. Like seriously now we as a customer don't even have a say on if we want to warm up our food!!!Appetizer:1 Chicken Tikka: LOL, seems more like boiled chicken with so much gravy.2. Chicken pepper fry: Humble request they need to put it under the entree. We even mistook it for chicken curry, since when did CPF become like a curry???Entree:1 Chicken tikka Masala: ordered 2 of these, Sour sour sour not even close to a CTM.2.Chicken Vindaloo: basically it's a chicken curry and again sour. Humble request to the owner either rename it to chicken curry in the menu or take it off.The first thing I did was call him in the morning and even asked him if he wants to see the pictures or if he could take the food away. But he keeps trying to lure you into getting it cooked again. Like after such a horrible experience, do you expect me to try your food again??? Regardless the Gobi manchurian, Bharwan paneer, Chana masala and naans was still edible.Please don't go by the ratings/reviews of this restaurant. Seems like owner has rated his own restaurant. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!Thanks for ruining my birthday."
Roberto M.,"Miami, FL",Great food. Very authentic and yummy. Glad they have made through the shutdown and slowdown of restaurants.
Pranabesh M.,"Factoria, Bellevue, WA","Never never never... don't go by name and pictures of its famous celebrity visits and all. They are either fake or they didn't put the pictures during or after effect once celebrities had the food. I wish there is a negative star button. Never go by the pictures and menu. This place is junk with worst food you can ever have. We ordered for a party of 10 and the food was sour taste like its been cooked 2days old. Called the owner who interrogated like i am lying about the food and then said if you had the food 2hours after picking it will be sour... lol. What to say man. ADVICE to the owner - update the menu and at least tell customer whats appetizer/starter and what is on-tray. Or if you don't know then take advice from neighboring restaurants they might help. Also do learn how to cook Indian food, get some good cooks that might cost you a little bit, but don't cook your self. CUSTOMERS- don't go by name. They all look nice Punjabi spicy dish, what you get is a pathetic sour blended gravy everywhere even in ""Tikka"" and ""tandoori"". This place don't know whats indian food they better serve only rice or Roti as they are good at making those only. If you are still end up ordering from this place, dont complain that why the food taste like shit, coz the restaurant will say ""thats the authentic style - Every thing will have a Tamarind taste"". If you don't have any other option I will still advice find one or dont eat, coz THIS PLACE IS DISGUSTING"
Jenny R.,"Riverview, FL","Absolutely loved the atmosphere! It felt warm and homemade, the people here were also very attentive and kind. The chicken Tikky Masala was phenomenal in flavor. I had asked for a recommendation since I've never been and the waitress gave me her favorite. I must say, the spices were right on point. The rice had the perfect texture for long grain.The naan bread was ok but not as soft as I expected. I don't recommend the wine if you are a frequent wine drinker. It was a bit to dry for a sweet wine and ok to drink but wouldn't order it again."
Teresa H.,"Milwaukee, WI","Soooo good!!I wasn't feeling great during our trip to Tampa and decided to get delivery to our hotel room. We went with flames after seeing how great the reviews are, and we were not let down.We got the tikka masala, samosas and garlic naan and it was all terrific. We don't have great Indian options where we're from so anytime I travel Indian is a must- this rivals my current best overall- Dishoom in London.Everything was very flavorful and rich and absolute perfection. Portions were hearty and great for the price. Would be back in a heartbeat."
Shafqat D.,"San Jose, CA","""The toilet's ready for you."" These are the words that the waiter said to me as he patted me on the back after walking out of the bathroom, on the way back to the kitchen. After being on a 2-hour drive to Tampa, I quickly hurry over to the bathroom in need of some relief......only to find a toilet that was VERY YELLOW and FOAMY. What the heck?!? This, I knew was the beginning of a terrible rollercoaster.We got some butter naan, rice butter chicken, chicken tikka masala and daal makhani. Without even thinking about whether the waiter cleaned his hand (!), I found the food to be among the blandest of food among all South Asian restaurants I've eaten at in recent memory. Seriously, what was the difference between the butter chicken and the chicken tikka masala? One spice and extra food coloring?The rice was decent but that's not saying much. I'll spare additional details and say that I wouldn't recommend this restaurant."
Denise B.,"Owensboro, KY",Very rude when went to order. I got the menu and just left. They didn't seem like they were in the best mood..I suggest calling before going or look rick
Elena L.,"Tampa, FL",I've never actually eaten inside the restaurant. Every time I see Flames is at the South Tampa Chamber of Commerce Business Expo. I love their food. The butter chicken is my favorite of theirs. Their rice is really good too!
Priyanka C.,"Fredericksburg, VA","Delicious Indian food! Highly recommend the spinach Malai kofta and the dal tadka!! I've never had spinach Malai kofta before but I absolutely loved it. The spinach was not too overpowering and tasted great with both the Naan and rice. My only complaint is regarding the naans as I wish they were a little more ""fluffier."" However overall my family and I had a great experience and we'd definitely come back!"
Jamie S.,"Tampa, FL","Flames serves up great indian food and should be considered one of the best restaurants in Tampa.It's my go to anytime I crave Indian.  Their garlic naan is the best.  I usually opt for the tandoori platter or chicken vindaloo (spiced up to med or hot).  Note:  their standard order of vindaloo is mild compared to other restaurants.  Nothing matches the flavor of the food when you eat at the restaurant, but you can also order through Uber Eats.  The restaurant has lots of indoor seating and ample parking. The service is also great and everyone who works there is super friendly.  Definitely check it out!"
Alti I.,"Seminole, FL","I stopped by this place to try out their lunch special, expecting a buffet, as most Indian places have a lunch time buffet, but this place was different. The decor was more of a formal, but relaxed, vibe. They offer 3 different options for their lunch: 1) Veggie, 2)Non-Vegie and 3) Deluxe (or Combination or something). I went with the non-veggie which came as follows. There was one big plate and on it was white rice, a chicken tandoori grill leg piece, a small metal bowl of daal (lentils), a small metal bowl of butter chicken, a small metal bowl of chicken tandoori masala and a small metal bowl of yogurt accompanied by a small ball of rice pudding. It also came with fresh butter naan which were actually the highlight of my meal. For $12 you get a small portion of a few different Indian dishes with 3-4 pieces of chicken cubes as big as a medium sized ice cube, fresh naan, a grilled leg of a chicken, white rice and lentils. That's a solid deal.You can't go into this expecting to have a hangry crisis to go away. But for that price, the quality of the food was pretty good. The rice pudding was the only thing I didn't care for, it was a bit too watery and too sweet.4/5 stars for sure. Would venture back here again.And for those that may wonder about the meat, the staff assured me that the chicken and lamb are halal."
Ben K.,"Tampa, FL",Pretty good chicken tikka masala but I asked for spicy and it was sort of like mild slightly disappointing
Dave O.,"New Smyrna Beach, FL","This restaurant is one of the top Indian Restaurants I've ever eaten at anywhere and it somewhat pains me to say this knowing that the more positive reviews they get the tougher it will become to get a table here (I'm kidding of course but it's true). This award winning restaurant has earned all the accolades it receives, the customer service here is attentive and they work hard to avoid any issues by setting the bar high for themselves, I really appreciated the staff following up on our order to ensure the content and level of spice was perfect - I made sure the owner understood I really wanted it ""Indian Hot"" and boy did they deliver the intense and aromatic spices were spot on, the complex flavors are absolutely amazing and certainly unmatched in my part of the world here on the east coast of Florida. I sometimes feel I'm a creature of habit when it comes to ordering food I am less familiar with, the lamb curry was amazing as was the butter chicken which I managed to steal a taste of. I have to admit though the Tandoori Lamb Chops stole the show these were absolutely incredible and well worth the cost to have these as a side dish although the portion could probably fed two on their own. It would also be an injustice not to mention the Garlic Naan here, let me tell you it's pretty special when it's delivered hot to the table. I wouldn't change a thing - there's no doubt I'd make the drive to explore more of this amazing food..."
Carter G.,"Tampa, FL","I'm relatively new to the Indian food game so forgive me for ordering the butter chicken and tikka masala. This lunch combo deal was great in terms of amount of food and price ($10), in addition to the food being delicious.We have gone back since this picture was taken and the lunch deal was not available, so I'm not sure if this deal is permanently gone or just occasionally offered.Without the combo deal, I won't come here as frequently, as the food is fairly pricey but it will be good for an occasional splurge. I look forward to branching out to different menu items but don't have much of an idea of where to start."
